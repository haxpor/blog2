Going out. Tidbits WeChat Mini-game Insights.
=========================================================

You know, I'm kinda in between introvert and extrovert. But lately, I've spent most of the time
inside the room trying to make the end meet (without success).

So whenever I go out of the room, it's like a caveman going out for sunshine.

Ok, the point is I kinda need to step back. I was on the mission to find the job after realize
I won't make it, there's no light at the end. I'm no longer happy with what I'm doing. It's slightly
shock that after graduated from the university back in 2011. Now it's mostly 8 years without a
major success or breakthrough on trying to be sustainable on things I was doing. Feeling of wasted?

I don't know. Now I'm 30. To be honest, I fear.

Anyway, I went to meet with this Chinese connection through my Chinese girlfriend. Three results
I got from meeting

1. New friends
2. More tidbits insights from WeChat mini-game market & ecosystem
3. Self-realization

Just skip first point, I'm mostly a human on earth with minimal friends.

## WeChat mini-game market

The following tidbits come from the Chinese guy I was talking to. He made 4 mini-games published on
WeChat mini-game platform published by Tencent; on behalf of his own personal account.

* 80-90% revenue split; favored to Tencent to publish your game on WeChat mini-game platform
* Tencent helps bring in ~8,000 new users daily
* One of the games which is freemium made ~2,000 RMB daily.
* Connections is important i.e. to uphold the limit of number of application can registered and published
, publishing and featured on the store, etc.

## Self-realization

At the near end of meeting, I came to realization that my strategy is so wrong and broken. Even I
knew what I should do, but I decided to follow what's right in my heart. "What's right" in this case
means things I just wanna do without regards to business.

He (the guy I was talking to) has very strong and good strategy. He stick to tech stack he already
had skill at (as did in his job during time in Tencent), and business goal-oriented. Get quick money
result from mini-game with simple similar game concept of those popular games in the market but with
slightly adaptation. Use cocoscreator as engine (the thing I don't like about honestly as I'm not
happy using it, unaligned to my energy which later costed me this result) for one code-base then
publish on various platform included QQ, and others which support mini-game.

The excitement of realization comes in that day and cool down in the next morning. I'm still a low
level guy loving to work with low level stack. At some point I might need to accept this trade-off.

I **can't go fast** with what I've chosen.

Web ecosystem mainly for games **is not aligning** with my energy.

The fear of not being successful is still there of what I've chosen.
