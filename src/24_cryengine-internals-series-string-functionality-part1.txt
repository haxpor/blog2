CryEngine Internals Series #1 - String Functionality Part 1
=========================================================

This is going to be the starting of _CryEngine Internals Series_. We will explore
functionalities provided as a base or foundation which publicly exposed to end-users, 
study various systems existing inside the code base, overall one by one, step by step
until I would be running out of the topics to write (in which I don't think that'd be the case).

Each post in the series will be marked with `#<number>` e.g. `#1` for ease of reference
back later, as well as easily track the progress of how far we made in the series.
