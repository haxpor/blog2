Geometric Primitives Notes
=========================================================

This is as part of Mathematics studying for Graphics and Game development notes (in series).

## Representation Techniques

It can be represented via

1. **Implicit Form**

    For example,

    $$ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 $$

    This equation is true for all points on the surface of a unit sphere centered at the origin.

2. **Parametric Form**

    For example,

    $$ x(t) = \cos 2{\pi}t $$
    $$ y(t) = \sin 2{\pi}t $$

3. ***Straightforward* Form**

    Capture the most important and obvious information directly. For example, line segment, it has 2
    endpoints. For a sphere, it has center and radius.

4. **Degrees of Freedom**

    Each one has its own *degrees of freedom*. It's a minimum number of required information to describe
    such geometric primitive. Often we will find redundant piece of information that we could eliminate
    i.e. vector having unit length.

## Line and Rays
### Parametric Representation of Rays

For 2D ray can be defined with the following parametric equations

$$ x(t) = x_0 + t{\Delta}x $$
$$ y(t) = y_0 + t{\Delta}y $$

Similarly to 3D as we just add another equation for another dimension to it.

To represent it in *vector* notation,

$$ p(t) = p_0 + td $$

### Special 2D Representation of Lines

In 2D we can represent line with

$$ ax + by = d $$

> **Note**: Other resource might use another form of (7) as
> $$ ax + by + d = 0 $$
> This flips the sign of $d$.

Alternatively, we can represent above equation with *dot product* as follows

$$ p \cdot n = d $$

Look closely, above two equations are in similar form of normal line equation as follows

$$ y = mx + b $$

$m$ is slope and called *rise over run*.

\
Notes for (9)

* $n$ which is unit vector gives the signed distance from the origin to the line. $d$ is positive if
the line moves in the direction of $n$.

## Spheres and Circles

The sphere equation comes from a simple definition of set of all points that are a given distance
from the center. Thus it comes down to

$$ {\Vert}p-c{\Vert} = r $$

where $p$ is any point on the surface of the sphere, $c$ is the center of the sphere, and $r$ is
the radius.

If we expand the above equation, then we get the form we get used to as follows.

$$ (x-c_x)^2 + (y-c_y)^2 + (z-c_z)^2 = r^2 $$

## Bounding Box
### Representing AABBs

It's based on keeping track of minimum and maximum value to represent the axis-aligned bounding box.

$$ P_{min} = [\ x_{min}\ \ y_{min}\ \ z_{min}\ ] $$
$$ P_{max} = [\ x_{max}\ \ y_{max}\ \ z_{max}\ ] $$

The center point $c$ is given by

$$ c = ( P_{min} + P_{max})/2 $$

The **size vector** $s$ is the vector from $P_{min}$ to $P_{max}$ in turns this contains width, height,
and length of the box.

We can get its radius by

$$ \begin{align*}
r &= P_{min} - c \\
  &= s/2
\end{align*}$$

## Planes
### Implicit Definition - The Plane Equation

$$ ax + by + cz = d $$
$$ p \cdot n = d $$

### Defining Using Three Points

Assume there are two edges. $e_1$ is $\overrightarrow {p_{2}p_{3}}$, and $e_3$ is $\overrightarrow {p_{2}p_{1}}$
in which those 3 points are in the plane.

$$ e_3 = p_2 - p_1 $$
$$ e_1 = p_3 - p_2 $$

### Distance from Point to Plane

Distance from point $p$ on the plane to point $q$ closest to it (which is not on the plane) is

$$ \begin{align*}
 p + an &= q  \\
 (p + an) \cdot n &= q \cdot n \\
 p \cdot n + (an) \cdot n &= q \cdot n \\
 d + a &= q \cdot n \\
 a &= q \cdot n -d
\end{align*}$$

where $a$ is the amount along $\vec n$.

## Triangles

Law of sines (see [proof](https://www.mathopenref.com/lawofsinesproof.html))

$$ \frac{\sin{\theta}_1}{l_1} = \frac{\sin{\theta}_2}{l_2} = \frac{\sin{\theta}_3}{l_3} $$

Law of cosines (see [proof](https://www.mathopenref.com/lawofcosinesproof.html))

$$ l_1^2 = l_2^2 + l_3^2 - 2l_2l_3\cos\theta_1 $$
$$ l_2^2 = l_1^2 + l_3^2 - 2l_1l_3\cos\theta_2 $$
$$ l_3^2 = l_1^2 + l_2^2 - 2l_1l_2\cos\theta_3 $$

Perimeter is

$$ p = l_1 + l_2 + l_3 $$

### Barycentric Space

Any point inside a triangle can be expressed as the weighted average of the vertices. The weights are
known as *barycentric coordinate*.

Conversion from barycentric coordinates to 3D position

$$ (b_1, b_2, b_3) \iff b_1v_1 + b_2v_2 + b_3v_3 $$

where $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 1$

We can interpret it as ratios of areas

$$ b_1 = A(T_1)/A(T) $$
$$ b_2 = A(T_2)/A(T) $$
$$ b_3 = A(T_3)/A(T) $$
