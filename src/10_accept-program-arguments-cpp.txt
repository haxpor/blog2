Ways to Accept Program's Arguments in C/C++
=========================================================

While I was solving some problem sets on Hackerrank, one curiosity pops up of what might be happening
for the program to accept external sample input test cases before executing to see its expected result.

The point is Hackerrank doesn't use a obvious way to accept arguments, but instead rely on `scanf` or
`std::cin`. I did further research and testing. This writeup is a result. Here I present you various
ways to accept program's arguments in C/C++. 

## 1. Main's arguments

We always see the following boilerplate code

```
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    ...
}
```

that is the main way to accept program's arguments from external. So users can execute the program
and supply parameters at the same time.

```
./myProgram.out param1 param2
```

and in terms of code, `argc` tells us how many parameters sending in included the first one which
is the name of the program (`./myProgram.out` itself). `argc` is 3 in this case.

We can access actual value for each one via `argv` i.e. `argv[0]` is `./myProgram.out`, `argv[1]` =
`param1` and so on.

## 2. Standard Input

Standard input in C is `scanf()`, and `std::cin` for C++.

This is the most **interesting** way to accept program's arguments. We can also take advantage of
OS support for piping external input into the program, pipe output from one program to be an input
of another. This makes it very convenient and flexible especially for competitive programming and
platform such as Hackerrank to be able to operate. Thus allows it to accept submitted source code
from users before compiling and executing with various several input test-cases.

Let's imagine if *input* requirement of a program is two numbers separated by space like below

```
1 5
```

and *output* requirement is a result of addition of those two numbers like below

```
6
```

With above two requirements of input and output, we then call `scanf()` or `std::cin` for number
of times matching with input requirement. So the complete program would be as follows

### C program

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    int a, b;
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
    printf("%d", a + b);
    return 0;
}
```

### C++ program

```
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    int a, b;
    std::cin >> a >> b;
    std::cout << (a + b);
    return 0;
}
```

As mentioned about taking advantage of OS support for piping, we can do the following

```
echo "1 5" | ./myProgram.out
```

Above will send in `1 5` as input string into `myProgram.out`, and either `scanf()` or `std::cin`
will be able to read from it properly.

Not only that, we can pipe input from file as follows

```
./myProgram.out < input.txt
```

wheres content of `input.txt` contains either oneline of input string

```
1 5
```

or multiple lines like

```
1
5
```

It will work the same!

So imagine further that we can pipe output from `myProgram.out` to be an input of another in chain
like following

```
input.txt > ./myProgram.out | ./myProgram2.out | ./myProgram3.out
```

That's amazing.

## 3. Change stream buffer of `std::cin` (C++ only)

As a bonus, we can change stream buffer `std::basic_ios::rdbuf`~[ref](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ios/rdbuf)~
which is the upper class[^1] that `cin` inherits from.

Just set `std::cin`'s `rdbuf` to whatever stream you want to read from i.e. file stream.

```
...

// content we want to read from via std::cin
std::ifstream fileIn("res/sample_input.txt");

// save pointer to stream buffer of std::cout
auto coutSBuf = std::cin.rdbuf();

// substitute internal std::cout buffer with buffer of fileIn
std::cin.rdbuf(fileIn.rdbuf());

// read content from std::cin into a string
std::string readString;
std::cin >> readString;
std::cout << readString << std::endl;

...
```

## (Extra) 4. Change stream buffer of `stdout` and `stdin` (C only)

It's possible to do similar in C only as well. It can be done via `freopen()` and optinal with the help of `dup()` to set back stream buffer.
Anyway it's by no mean reliable and portable, thus I'm not showing any source code example here. You can take a look for more information [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1908687/how-to-redirect-the-output-back-to-the-screen-after-freopenout-txt-a-stdo), and [here](http://c-faq.com/stdio/undofreopen.html).

In short, better use `fscanf()` or `fprintf()` everywhere as we can control which stream buffer to input or output, thus we can set back any stream buffer under control at will, at anytime. See this [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1910044/571227) for more information on example code.
