Vulkan pNext and Query for New Additional Structure
=========================================================

Whenever there's new revision of Vulkan spec, its SDK catches up. We will usually see new structures or function names with suffix of `2`.

Let's take a slightly more complicated than usual to query for new revision structure added from previous spec version. To know whether the device supports [separate](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-separateDepthStencilLayouts) [Depth/Stencil layouts](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_separate_depth_stencil_layouts.html), we need to use `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` function which involves strcutures `VkPhysicalDeviceSeparateDepthStencilLayoutsFeatures`, and `VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2` by setting the latter structure's `pNext` field to pointer of the former structure.

The following code is how to do it.

```
    /* remember to set .sType for extension structure to hold the information */
    VkPhysicalDeviceSeparateDepthStencilLayoutsFeatures dsf = {};
    dsf.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_SEPARATE_DEPTH_STENCIL_LAYOUTS_FEATURES;

    /* create a required structure then set its .pNext to the former */
    VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures2 query = {};
    query.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_FEATURES_2;
    query.pNext = &dsf;
    vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures2(physicalDevice, &query);
```

Now the following is extra information as if we would likely need to enable such feature on device whenever we create.

```
    VkDeviceCreateInfo createInfo = {};
    createInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_CREATE_INFO;
    createInfo.pNext = &dsf;
    ...
    
    if (vkCreateDevice(physicalDevice, &createInfo, nullptr, &device) != VK_SUCCESS)
        throw std::runtime_error("failed to create device!");
```

The catch needed to be remember is that `sType` field of `dsf` variable above needs to be set. If you didn't set it, calling `vkGetPhysicalDeviceFeatures` won't set any returned value to `VkPhysicalDeviceSeparateDepthStencilLayoutsFeatures`.
